# Retail-Company-Sales-Analysis
A use case on a product based retail company's sales,which business have spread in some country. 
Here I have tried to understand their sales and specilally their customer and their purchases.
Based on Income of customers and customers purchase behaviour company have run their advertisement campaign and there is positive effect on comapany sales and company
have retained some of there customer.
While customers who purchaeses from the company are not very rich majority of the customer have salary under 1000k so based on that buseness owner can put products.
